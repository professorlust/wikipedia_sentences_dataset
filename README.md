Each file contains a number of paragraphs. These paragraphs contains several sentences, which are contiguous on Wikipedia. Each sentence is written on one line. The paragraphs are divided by the symbol `+++$+++`. 

## Note
I have tried to remove as many incoherences as I could find. However, there are still mistakes on it. Especially, these files contain non-latin characters, which I have not removed.
